# Distributed Key-Value Store using Consistent Hashing and gRPC

(Ongoing)
Developing a distributed Key-Value store in Go with sharded nodes managed by an external (for now) coordinator leveraging consistent hashing for key partitioning, replication, and fault tolerance, with gRPC/Protobuf for inter-service communication. 

Going ahead, planning to add auto-scaling (and containerization), health checks, and dynamic rebalancing.
